Starting with the fine generic library from https://github.com/taterbase/libvt100

Ultimately this will be a general terminal tool for the VR libraries for the VRWorld's Browser.

Starting off with a simple Windows.Forms terminal tool and libssh to make a putty/ssh like tool.  Eventually want to get libvt100 to the point where it's pretty much fully xterm compatible, and has some other features I'd like to see.

Then another client will be written to actually allow this to work in Unity3D.
